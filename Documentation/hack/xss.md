# XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

## Definition

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

## How It Works

## Detection

XSS vulnerabilities can be detected by:
- Using tootls / frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design.
- Utilizing automated scanning tools designed to discover common web application vulnerabilities.
- Conducting thorough code reviews to identify potential injection points.

## Prevention

To prevent XSS attacks:
- Sanitize all user input to remove or encode potentially malicious content.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the types of content that can be executed on a webpage.


## Example Scenarios

Injection with the script does this:
```js
{
      id: 1,
      author: "John Doe",
      content: "This is my first post! <script>alert('hey');</script> This is my first",
      timestamp: "2023-01-01T12:00:00",         
      likes: 20,
      comments: [
        {
          commenter: "Jane Doe",
          comment: "This is my first post!",
        },
      ],
    },
```

the result is:

In this case, the hacker executes a script on your webpage which could potentially give them access to your session ID, tokens, and personal information such as your full name.

## How to do it ? (deprecate: probleme of frameword don't allow it)

You need to write a blog post with a comment section. The comment section must be vulnerable to XSS. like this:

then all the users will exec you script when they will read your post. Example:
